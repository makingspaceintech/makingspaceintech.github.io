          <p>
          Our goal is to run accessible Hackathons that allow people to experiement and learn new skills
          as well as build up their portfolio and network.
          <br />
          A Hackathon is an event where teams are made from the people who attend.  The teams then are presented
          with a problem that they work to solve together.
